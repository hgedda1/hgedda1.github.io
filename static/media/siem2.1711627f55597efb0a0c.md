Project Report: Threat Intelligence Integration with SIEM

# 1. Project Overview
 
Objective:
 
The objective of this project is to enhance a SIEM system by integrating threat intelligence feeds to improve detection capabilities and incident response. By incorporating external threat intelligence sources, the SIEM can better detect known threats and provide a faster, more informed response to security incidents.
 
Tools Used:
 
- AlienVault OSSIM: Open-source SIEM for log collection, correlation, and alerting.
 
- MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform): For threat intelligence management and sharing.
 
- Open Threat Exchange (OTX): For real-time threat intelligence feeds on emerging threats.
 
# 2. Project Scope
 
The project involves the following key steps:  
 1. Set up AlienVault OSSIM for centralized log collection and analysis.  
 2. Integrate threat intelligence from MISP and OTX.  
 3. Enhance SIEM correlation rules using threat intelligence data.  
 4. Simulate and detect security incidents in real time.  
 5. Document the detection, analysis, and remediation process.
 
# 3. Project Implementation
 
## 3.1: Set Up AlienVault OSSIM
 
3.1.1 Deploying AlienVault OSSIM:
 
AlienVault OSSIM was deployed in a virtual environment to serve as the SIEM platform. OSSIM was configured to collect logs from network devices, servers, and applications for real-time analysis.
 
3.1.2 Log Collection:
 
AlienVault was configured to collect and analyze logs from multiple sources, including firewall logs, system logs, and application logs.
 
## 3.2: Integrate Threat Intelligence
 
3.2.1 Setting up MISP Integration:
 
MISP was set up to receive and manage threat intelligence feeds. It was then integrated with AlienVault OSSIM to enrich the SIEM system with relevant threat data.
 
3.2.2 OTX Integration:
 
AlienVault OSSIM was connected to the Open Threat Exchange (OTX) to receive real-time intelligence on emerging threats. This provided an additional layer of detection for new and evolving threats.
 
## 3.3: Correlation Rule Enhancement
 
3.3.1 Enhancing Correlation Rules:
 
AlienVault OSSIM’s correlation rules were enhanced using threat intelligence data from MISP and OTX. New rules were configured to detect indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to known threats.
 
3.3.2 Configuring Alerts:
 
Alerts were configured to trigger on the detection of specific IOCs, such as IP addresses, file hashes, and domain names associated with malicious activity.
 
## 3.4: Incident Detection and Response
 
3.4.1 Simulating Security Incidents:
 
Various security incidents were simulated, including phishing attacks, malware infections, and network intrusions. These incidents were designed to trigger alerts based on the integrated threat intelligence.
 
3.4.2 Real-time Detection:
 
The SIEM system detected the simulated incidents in real-time by correlating log data with threat intelligence feeds. AlienVault OSSIM generated alerts for each incident, which were then analyzed.
 
3.4.3 Incident Response:
 
The steps taken to respond to each incident were documented, including log analysis, IOC identification, and remediation actions.
 
## 3.5: Reporting and Documentation
 
3.5.1 Incident Reports:
 
Detailed reports were generated for each security incident, including the detection process, analysis, and the steps taken to mitigate the threat. These reports provided a clear understanding of how the SIEM system handled each incident.
 
3.5.2 Integration Documentation:
 
The integration process for MISP and OTX with AlienVault OSSIM was documented, highlighting the benefits of incorporating external threat intelligence feeds to improve the SIEM’s detection capabilities.
 
# 4. Challenges and Solutions
 
Challenge: Ensuring that the SIEM could handle the volume of threat intelligence data from multiple sources.
 
Solution: Configured filtering and prioritization rules to ensure that only relevant threat data was used for correlation and alerting.
 
Challenge: Detecting complex threats that do not match known IOCs.
 
Solution: Enhanced correlation rules by combining multiple data points and threat intelligence to identify subtle, sophisticated threats.
 
# 5. Outcome
 
The project successfully integrated threat intelligence feeds with the AlienVault OSSIM SIEM system, resulting in improved detection capabilities. The integration of MISP and OTX provided real-time intelligence on emerging threats, while the enhanced correlation rules allowed for faster detection and response to incidents.
 
# 6. Future Improvements
 
Future improvements could include incorporating machine learning techniques for advanced anomaly detection and automating incident response workflows to reduce response times further.
 
# 7. Conclusion
 
This project successfully demonstrated the value of integrating external threat intelligence with a SIEM system. By incorporating threat feeds from MISP and OTX, the SIEM was able to detect and respond to known threats in real-time. The enhanced correlation rules and real-time threat data significantly improved the system’s detection capabilities.
