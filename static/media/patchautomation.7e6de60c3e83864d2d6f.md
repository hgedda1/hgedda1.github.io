Project Report: Comprehensive Vulnerability Management and Patch Automation

# 1. Project Overview
 
## Objective:
 
The objective of this project is to create a robust vulnerability management system that identifies, assesses, and remediates vulnerabilities through automated patch management.
 
## Tools Used:
 
- Vulnerability Scanning: OpenVAS, Nessus (Free Trial).  
 - Patch Management: WSUS, Ansible.  
 - Threat Intelligence: MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform).  
 - SIEM Integration: AlienVault OSSIM.
 
# 2. Project Scope
 
The project involves the following key steps:  
 1. Set Up a Test Environment.  
 2. Conduct Vulnerability Scanning.  
 3. Patch Automation.  
 4. Integrate Threat Intelligence.  
 5. SIEM Monitoring.  
 6. Documentation.
 
# 3. Project Implementation
 
## Step 1: Set Up a Test Environment
 
1.1 Deploy virtual machines simulating a corporate network, including Windows and Linux servers, and intentionally introduce vulnerabilities using Metasploitable or a similar tool.
 
## Step 2: Conduct Vulnerability Scanning
 
2.1 Perform vulnerability scans using OpenVAS and Nessus.  
 2.2 Identify critical vulnerabilities and prioritize them based on risk assessment.
 
## Step 3: Patch Automation
 
3.1 Set up WSUS for Windows-based systems and automate patch deployment across the network using Ansible for both Windows and Linux systems.  
 3.2 Implement a patch management policy, ensuring regular updates and minimal downtime.
 
## Step 4: Integrate Threat Intelligence
 
4.1 Integrate MISP with AlienVault OSSIM to enrich vulnerability data with threat intelligence.  
 4.2 Automatically correlate discovered vulnerabilities with current threat intelligence to assess the urgency and potential impact of each issue.
 
## Step 5: SIEM Monitoring
 
5.1 Use AlienVault OSSIMâ€™s SIEM capabilities to monitor network activity and log data for signs of exploitation of identified vulnerabilities.  
 5.2 Set up alerts for critical vulnerabilities and suspicious activities.
 
## Step 6: Documentation
 
6.1 Document the entire process, including the setup, scans, patch management, threat intelligence integration, and SIEM monitoring.  
 6.2 Create reports showing the initial vulnerabilities, the remediation steps taken, and the security posture improvement over time.
 
# 4. Challenges and Solutions
 
Challenge: Ensuring timely remediation of identified vulnerabilities while minimizing disruption to business operations.  
 Solution: Automated patch management with WSUS and Ansible, combined with continuous monitoring through AlienVault OSSIM, provided a streamlined solution for addressing vulnerabilities efficiently.
 
# 5. Outcome
 
The project successfully implemented a comprehensive vulnerability management system that integrates automated patching and threat intelligence. Skills were developed in vulnerability scanning, automated patch management, and SIEM monitoring. Demonstrated the ability to proactively manage and mitigate security risks using industry-standard tools.
 
# 6. Future Improvements
 
Future improvements could include expanding patch automation to more platforms and integrating machine learning to predict and prioritize vulnerabilities based on emerging threats.
 
# 7. Conclusion
 
This project demonstrated the ability to implement and manage a comprehensive vulnerability management system, ensuring proactive identification and remediation of security risks.
