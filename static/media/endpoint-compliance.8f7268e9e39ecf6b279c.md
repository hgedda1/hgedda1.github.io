Project Report: Endpoint Compliance and Patch Management

# 1. Project Overview
 
## Objective:
 
The objective of this project is to ensure endpoint compliance with security policies and manage patch deployment to protect against vulnerabilities.
 
## Tools Used:
 
- WSUS (Windows Server Update Services): For patch management.  
 - ManageEngine Desktop Central (Free Trial): For endpoint management and compliance.  
 - OSQuery: For endpoint monitoring.  
 - CIS-CAT (CIS Configuration Assessment Tool): For compliance checks.
 
# 2. Project Scope
 
The project involves the following key steps:  
 1. Patch Management Setup.  
 2. Endpoint Compliance Monitoring.  
 3. Automate Patch Deployment.  
 4. Monitor and Report.  
 5. Documentation.
 
# 3. Project Implementation
 
## Step 1: Patch Management Setup
 
1.1 Configure WSUS to manage and deploy patches to Windows-based endpoints in a virtual environment.  
 1.2 Use ManageEngine Desktop Central to manage patching on both Windows and macOS endpoints.
 
## Step 2: Endpoint Compliance Monitoring
 
2.1 Use CIS-CAT to perform compliance checks against industry benchmarks such as CIS, NIST, and PCI-DSS.  
 2.2 Integrate OSQuery with ManageEngine Desktop Central to monitor the configuration and compliance status of endpoints.
 
## Step 3: Automate Patch Deployment
 
3.1 Set up automated patch deployment policies in WSUS and ManageEngine Desktop Central.  
 3.2 Schedule regular compliance scans and ensure that all endpoints are up-to-date with security patches.
 
## Step 4: Monitor and Report
 
4.1 Monitor patch deployment progress and compliance status using ManageEngine Desktop Centralâ€™s dashboard.  
 4.2 Generate reports on patch compliance and security posture for endpoints.
 
## Step 5: Documentation
 
5.1 Document the setup process, including tool configuration, patch deployment, and compliance monitoring.  
 5.2 Provide detailed reports on the security posture of the endpoints, highlighting any areas that require attention.
 
# 4. Challenges and Solutions
 
Challenge: Ensuring consistent patch deployment across different operating systems and maintaining endpoint compliance.  
 Solution: Used WSUS and ManageEngine Desktop Central to automate patch deployment and integrated OSQuery for real-time monitoring of endpoint compliance.
 
# 5. Outcome
 
The project successfully managed endpoint compliance and patch deployment using WSUS, ManageEngine Desktop Central, OSQuery, and CIS-CAT. Skills were developed in automating patch management and ensuring endpoints are protected against vulnerabilities. Demonstrated the ability to monitor, report, and maintain endpoint security.
 
# 6. Future Improvements
 
Future improvements could include expanding patch management to additional platforms and automating more parts of the compliance monitoring process.
 
# 7. Conclusion
 
This project demonstrated the ability to implement and manage endpoint compliance and patch management, ensuring that endpoints are up-to-date and protected against vulnerabilities.
