Project Report: Comprehensive Endpoint Protection and Response

# 1. Project Overview
 
## Objective:
 
The objective of this project is to set up a comprehensive endpoint security solution that protects against malware, ransomware, and other advanced threats, while also providing detection and response capabilities.
 
## Tools Used:
 
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (Free Trial).  
 - Malwarebytes (Free Trial).  
 - OSQuery: For endpoint monitoring.  
 - Splunk (Free Trial): For log collection and analysis.
 
# 2. Project Scope
 
The project involves the following key steps:  
 1. Set Up Endpoint Protection.  
 2. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR).  
 3. Log Collection and Analysis.  
 4. Simulate and Respond to Attacks.  
 5. Reporting and Documentation.
 
# 3. Project Implementation
 
## Step 1: Set Up Endpoint Protection
 
1.1 Install Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Malwarebytes on a set of virtual machines to provide antivirus and anti-malware protection.  
 1.2 Configure real-time protection, scheduled scans, and automatic updates.
 
## Step 2: Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
 
2.1 Enable and configure the EDR capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to monitor and detect suspicious activities on endpoints.  
 2.2 Use OSQuery to collect detailed information on running processes, network connections, and file integrity.
 
## Step 3: Log Collection and Analysis
 
3.1 Set up Splunk to collect logs from Microsoft Defender, Malwarebytes, and OSQuery.  
 3.2 Create dashboards in Splunk to monitor endpoint security events, such as detected threats, blocked malware, and suspicious activities.
 
## Step 4: Simulate and Respond to Attacks
 
4.1 Simulate common cyber threats like malware infections, ransomware attacks, and phishing attempts on the endpoints.  
 4.2 Monitor the response of the endpoint security solutions, analyze the logs, and document the steps taken to contain and remediate the threats.
 
## Step 5: Reporting and Documentation
 
5.1 Generate detailed reports on detected threats, the effectiveness of the endpoint protection solutions, and response actions.  
 5.2 Document the entire process, including the configuration of tools, attack simulations, and the incident response process.
 
# 4. Challenges and Solutions
 
Challenge: Ensuring comprehensive detection and response across different endpoint devices while managing large volumes of logs.  
 Solution: Integrated Microsoft Defender, Malwarebytes, OSQuery, and Splunk to provide a unified system for protection, detection, and response.
 
# 5. Outcome
 
The project successfully implemented and managed comprehensive endpoint protection and response solutions using Microsoft Defender, Malwarebytes, OSQuery, and Splunk. Gained experience in detecting, analyzing, and responding to endpoint-level threats using industry-standard tools, with skills developed in log collection, analysis, and reporting.
 
# 6. Future Improvements
 
Future improvements could include integrating machine learning for proactive threat detection and automating more parts of the incident response process.
 
# 7. Conclusion
 
This project demonstrated the ability to implement and manage a comprehensive endpoint security solution, protecting against advanced threats while providing detailed detection and response capabilities.
