Project Report: Implementing Endpoint Security with Open Source Tools

# 1. Project Overview
 
## Objective:
 
The objective of this project is to set up a cost-effective, open-source endpoint security solution to protect against and respond to cyber threats.
 
## Tools Used:
 
- ClamAV: Open-source antivirus.  
 - Wazuh: Open-source security monitoring.  
 - OSSEC: Open-source host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS).  
 - Graylog: For log management and analysis.
 
# 2. Project Scope
 
The project involves the following key steps:  
 1. Set Up Endpoint Protection.  
 2. Intrusion Detection and Monitoring.  
 3. Log Management and Analysis.  
 4. Simulate Attacks and Respond.  
 5. Reporting and Documentation.
 
# 3. Project Implementation
 
## Step 1: Set Up Endpoint Protection
 
1.1 Install ClamAV on Linux and Windows virtual machines to provide antivirus protection.  
 1.2 Schedule regular scans and set up automatic updates for ClamAV.
 
## Step 2: Intrusion Detection and Monitoring
 
2.1 Deploy Wazuh and OSSEC on the endpoints to monitor for suspicious activities and intrusions.  
 2.2 Configure Wazuh to send alerts based on predefined rules for detecting malware, unauthorized access, and system anomalies.
 
## Step 3: Log Management and Analysis
 
3.1 Set up Graylog to collect and analyze logs from ClamAV, Wazuh, and OSSEC.  
 3.2 Create dashboards in Graylog to monitor endpoint security events in real-time.
 
## Step 4: Simulate Attacks and Respond
 
4.1 Simulate common attack scenarios such as malware infections and unauthorized access attempts.  
 4.2 Monitor the detection and response capabilities of the open-source tools and analyze the collected logs.
 
## Step 5: Reporting and Documentation
 
5.1 Generate reports on the effectiveness of the endpoint security setup, including detected threats and response actions.  
 5.2 Document the entire process, including tool installation, configuration, and incident response.
 
# 4. Challenges and Solutions
 
Challenge: Ensuring consistent protection across different endpoint environments with open-source tools.  
 Solution: Integrated ClamAV, Wazuh, OSSEC, and Graylog to create a cost-effective, yet comprehensive, endpoint security solution.
 
# 5. Outcome
 
The project successfully implemented an open-source endpoint security solution using ClamAV, Wazuh, OSSEC, and Graylog. Skills were developed in detecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threats using cost-effective tools, demonstrating the ability to manage and monitor endpoint security.
 
# 6. Future Improvements
 
Future improvements could include automating more aspects of the incident response process and integrating additional open-source tools for advanced threat detection.
 
# 7. Conclusion
 
This project demonstrated the ability to implement and manage a cost-effective, open-source endpoint security solution, ensuring protection against various cyber threats while monitoring and analyzing security events.
