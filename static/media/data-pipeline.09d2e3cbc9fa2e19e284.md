Project Report: Cloud-Based Data Pipeline for Real-Time Analytics

# 1. Project Overview
 
## Objective:
 
The objective of this project is to build a robust cloud-based data pipeline to support real-time analytics for underwriting and claims, enabling faster decision-making and improving data insights.
 
## Tools Used:
 
- AWS Kinesis: For real-time data ingestion and streaming.  
 - AWS Lambda: For serverless data processing in real time.  
 - AWS S3: For data storage and data lake creation.  
 - AWS Redshift: For data warehousing and querying.  
 - AWS Glue: For ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations.  
 - AWS QuickSight: For real-time data visualization and analytics.
