Project Report: Digital Forensics Investigation

# 1. Project Overview
 
## Objective:
 
The objective of this project is to conduct a digital forensics investigation to uncover the root cause of a cybersecurity incident. The investigation focuses on gathering evidence for further action and providing remediation recommendations.
 
## Tools Used:
 
- Autopsy (Open Source): For digital forensics analysis.  
 - FTK Imager (Free): For forensic imaging and data collection.  
 - Wireshark (Open Source): For network traffic analysis.
 
# 2. Project Scope
 
The project involves the following key steps:  
 1. Forensic Data Collection.  
 2. Digital Forensics Analysis with Autopsy.  
 3. Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark.  
 4. Document Findings and Gather Evidence.  
 5. Reporting and Remediation.
 
# 3. Project Implementation
 
## Step 1: Forensic Data Collection
 
1.1 Use FTK Imager to create a forensic image of the affected systems, ensuring data integrity.  
 1.2 Collect logs, memory dumps, and other relevant data from the compromised devices.
 
## Step 2: Digital Forensics Analysis with Autopsy
 
2.1 Analyze the forensic images using Autopsy to uncover indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as malicious files, unauthorized access, and data exfiltration.  
 2.2 Recover deleted files and analyze system artifacts to piece together the attack timeline.
 
## Step 3: Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark
 
3.1 Capture and analyze network traffic related to the incident using Wireshark.  
 3.2 Identify suspicious connections, data transfers, and potential command-and-control (C2) traffic.
 
## Step 4: Document Findings and Gather Evidence
 
4.1 Document all findings from the forensic analysis, including IOCs, attack vectors, and affected systems.  
 4.2 Gather and preserve evidence in a format that is admissible in legal proceedings.
 
## Step 5: Reporting and Remediation
 
5.1 Generate a comprehensive forensics report detailing the root cause of the incident, the extent of the damage, and recommendations for remediation.  
 5.2 Collaborate with the incident response team to implement the necessary remediation measures.
 
# 4. Challenges and Solutions
 
Challenge: Ensuring data integrity during forensic imaging and analysis.  
 Solution: Used FTK Imager to create verified forensic images and Autopsy for in-depth analysis, ensuring the accuracy of findings.
 
# 5. Outcome
 
This project provided hands-on experience in digital forensics investigation. Tools such as Autopsy, FTK Imager, and Wireshark were used to collect and analyze data, uncover the root cause of cybersecurity incidents, and provide actionable recommendations for remediation.
 
# 6. Future Improvements
 
Future improvements could include incorporating advanced threat hunting techniques to identify covert attack vectors and integrating more automation into forensic data analysis.
 
# 7. Conclusion
 
This project demonstrated proficiency in conducting digital forensics investigations using industry-standard tools. The ability to uncover root causes, preserve evidence, and provide recommendations for remediation is critical for managing cybersecurity incidents.
