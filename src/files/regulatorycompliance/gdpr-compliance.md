The project involves the following key steps:  
 1. Assess GDPR Readiness.  
 2. Implement GDPR Controls.  
 3. Monitor and Manage Compliance.  
 4. Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs).  
 5. Reporting and Documentation.
 
# 3. Project Implementation
 
## Step 1: Assess GDPR Readiness
 
1.1 Use OneTrust to assess the organizationâ€™s current data protection practices against GDPR requirements.  
 1.2 Identify gaps in compliance and create a roadmap for achieving full compliance.
 
## Step 2: Implement GDPR Controls
 
2.1 Use Azure Compliance Manager to implement controls such as data encryption, access controls, and data minimization.  
 2.2 Ensure that data processing activities are documented and that appropriate consents are obtained for processing personal data.
 
## Step 3: Monitor and Manage Compliance
 
3.1 Set up the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center to monitor data protection activities, enforce data loss prevention (DLP) policies, and manage data retention.  
 3.2 Use compliance scorecards and dashboards to track compliance status and report to stakeholders.
 
## Step 4: Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)
 
4.1 Use OneTrust to conduct DPIAs for new projects or data processing activities that involve personal data.  
 4.2 Identify and mitigate privacy risks associated with these activities.
 
## Step 5: Reporting and Documentation
 
5.1 Document the entire compliance process, including DPIAs, consent management, and implemented controls.  
 5.2 Generate GDPR compliance reports to demonstrate adherence to regulatory requirements during audits.
