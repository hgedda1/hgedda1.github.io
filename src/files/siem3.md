Project Report: Compliance Monitoring and Reporting Using SIEM

# 1. Project Overview
 
Objective:
 
The objective of this project is to implement a SIEM-based compliance monitoring solution to ensure adherence to security policies and regulatory requirements. The project involves using Splunk for log analysis and reporting, CIS-CAT for compliance checks, and OSQuery for endpoint monitoring.
 
Tools Used:
 
- Splunk (Free Trial): For log analysis, compliance monitoring, and reporting.
 
- CIS-CAT (CIS Configuration Assessment Tool): For performing compliance checks against industry benchmarks.
 
- OSQuery: For endpoint monitoring and gathering compliance-related data.
 
# 2. Project Scope
 
The project involves the following key steps:  
 1. Set up Splunk for centralized log collection and analysis.  
 2. Perform compliance checks using CIS-CAT and collect data for analysis.  
 3. Monitor endpoints using OSQuery and integrate the data into Splunk.  
 4. Create automated reports and dashboards to visualize compliance status.  
 5. Document the setup process and provide detailed reports on compliance deviations and remediation actions.
 
# 3. Project Implementation
 
## 3.1: Set Up Splunk
 
3.1.1 Deploying Splunk:
 
Splunk was deployed in a virtual environment, and data inputs were configured to collect logs from various endpoints and network devices. These inputs included Windows Event Logs, Linux syslogs, and application logs.
 
3.1.2 Log Collection:
 
Splunk was set up to collect and index logs in real-time for later analysis. This data formed the basis for compliance monitoring and reporting.
 
## 3.2: Compliance Monitoring
 
3.2.1 Performing Compliance Checks with CIS-CAT:
 
CIS-CAT was used to perform compliance checks against industry benchmarks such as CIS, NIST, and PCI-DSS. The tool provided detailed reports on the compliance status of various systems.
 
3.2.2 Feeding Compliance Data into Splunk:
 
Compliance data collected from CIS-CAT was fed into Splunk for centralized analysis. This allowed for a unified view of compliance across different systems.
 
## 3.3: Endpoint Monitoring
 
3.3.1 Deploying OSQuery:
 
OSQuery was deployed on endpoints to monitor system configurations, software versions, and compliance status. It provided real-time data on the security posture of the endpoints.
 
3.3.2 Integrating OSQuery with Splunk:
 
OSQuery was integrated with Splunk to collect and analyze endpoint data. This provided insights into endpoint compliance status and helped identify systems that were out of compliance.
 
## 3.4: Automated Reporting
 
3.4.1 Creating Dashboards in Splunk:
 
Dashboards were created in Splunk to visualize the compliance status across the organization. These dashboards displayed key metrics such as the number of compliant/non-compliant systems, configuration issues, and software vulnerabilities.
 
3.4.2 Setting up Automated Reports:
 
Automated reports were configured to track compliance over time. These reports provided daily/weekly summaries of the compliance status, highlighting systems that required remediation.
 
## 3.5: Documentation and Reporting
 
3.5.1 Documenting the Setup Process:
 
The process of setting up Splunk, CIS-CAT, and OSQuery for compliance monitoring was documented in detail. This included tool configuration, data collection processes, and reporting setups.
 
3.5.2 Providing Detailed Compliance Reports:
 
Detailed reports were generated on the compliance status of the organization. These reports highlighted any deviations from industry benchmarks and provided recommendations for remediation actions.
 
# 4. Challenges and Solutions
 
Challenge: Handling large volumes of logs and compliance data from multiple endpoints and systems.
 
Solution: Splunkâ€™s indexing and search capabilities were optimized to handle the data volume efficiently, and dashboards were configured to focus on key compliance metrics.
 
Challenge: Ensuring continuous compliance across a diverse IT environment.
 
Solution: OSQuery was used to monitor endpoint configurations continuously, and automated compliance checks were run regularly to ensure that systems remained compliant.
 
# 5. Outcome
 
The project successfully demonstrated the implementation of a SIEM-based solution for compliance monitoring. Splunk was used to collect and analyze log data from various systems, while CIS-CAT and OSQuery provided detailed compliance checks. Dashboards and automated reports provided real-time visibility into the compliance status, enabling faster identification and remediation of compliance issues.
 
# 6. Future Improvements
 
Future improvements could include integrating machine learning capabilities in Splunk to predict non-compliance trends and automatically flag high-risk systems. Additional benchmarks could also be added to CIS-CAT to cover more regulatory requirements.
 
# 7. Conclusion
 
This project successfully implemented a compliance monitoring solution using Splunk, CIS-CAT, and OSQuery. By centralizing log and compliance data in Splunk, the organization gained real-time visibility into its compliance status. The project demonstrated the ability to use SIEM tools for compliance monitoring and reporting, ensuring adherence to security policies and regulatory requirements.
