Project Report: Conducting a Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Audit

# 1. Project Overview
 
## Objective:
 
The objective of this project is to perform a cybersecurity risk assessment audit to evaluate the effectiveness of an organization's risk management practices and identify areas for improvement.
 
## Tools Used:
 
- ISO 27005: For risk management guidelines.  
 - OpenVAS (Open Source): For vulnerability scanning.  
 - Qualys (Free Trial): For risk assessment and reporting.  
 - Excel or Google Sheets: For audit documentation.
 
# 2. Project Scope
 
The project involves the following key steps:  
 1. Define the Audit Scope and Objectives.  
 2. Conduct Vulnerability Scanning with OpenVAS.  
 3. Perform Risk Assessment with Qualys.  
 4. Evaluate Risk Management Practices.  
 5. Reporting and Documentation.
 
# 3. Project Implementation
 
## Step 1: Define the Audit Scope and Objectives
 
1.1 Establish the scope of the audit, focusing on specific areas such as network security, data protection, or access control.  
 1.2 Define the audit objectives, including evaluating existing risk management practices and identifying gaps.
 
## Step 2: Conduct Vulnerability Scanning with OpenVAS
 
2.1 Use OpenVAS to scan the organization's network for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by cyber threats.  
 2.2 Analyze the scan results to identify critical vulnerabilities and assess their potential impact.
 
## Step 3: Perform Risk Assessment with Qualys
 
3.1 Use Qualys to assess the organization's risk posture by identifying and analyzing security weaknesses.  
 3.2 Generate risk assessment reports to provide a comprehensive view of the organization's cyber risks.
 
## Step 4: Evaluate Risk Management Practices
 
4.1 Compare the organization's risk management practices against ISO 27005 guidelines.  
 4.2 Identify gaps in risk management and recommend improvements based on the audit findings.
 
## Step 5: Reporting and Documentation
 
5.1 Document the audit process, including the scope, methodology, findings, and recommendations.  
 5.2 Generate a detailed audit report that outlines the current risk posture and provides actionable insights for improvement.
 
# 4. Challenges and Solutions
 
Challenge: Ensuring comprehensive coverage of the organization's risk landscape while adhering to audit scope.  
 Solution: Utilized OpenVAS and Qualys for in-depth vulnerability scanning and risk assessment, supported by ISO 27005 guidelines.
 
# 5. Outcome
 
The project successfully conducted a cybersecurity risk assessment audit, evaluating the organization's risk management practices. Skills were developed in vulnerability scanning, risk analysis, and audit reporting. The audit provided actionable insights for improving risk management.
 
# 6. Future Improvements
 
Future improvements could include automating parts of the audit process and integrating additional risk assessment tools to cover emerging vulnerabilities and threats.
 
# 7. Conclusion
